# OOP_final_project

### Description
This project is the final assignment for the Object-Oriented Programming course, where we used Python to develop a model for analyzing and predicting the likelihood of a person experiencing a stroke. The project involved several key techniques that enhanced the model's performance and accuracy.

During the data preprocessing phase, we implemented Hash Encoding to efficiently encode categorical variables, ensuring that the model could effectively handle diverse data inputs. To address the challenge of imbalanced data, we combined SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) with ENN (Edited Nearest Neighbors), which helped create a more balanced dataset and improved the modelâ€™s predictive capabilities.

In addition to standard predictive modeling, we explored anomaly detection methods, including One-Class SVM and Extreme Boosting-Based Outlier Detection, to enhance our predictions. These techniques were particularly valuable in identifying outliers that could indicate potential stroke cases.
