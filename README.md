# OOP_final_project

---
### Description
This is the final project for the Object-oriented programming course. We used python programming language to analyze and predict whether a person has a stroke. The most interesting part of this project is that, in the data preprocessing process, We used the Hash Encoding technique to encode the categorical variables and we used SMOTE + ENN to deal with imbalanced data. Moreover, we tried to use anomaly detection techniques to predict, such as OneClass SVM, Extreme Boosting Based Outlier Detection.
